        Canal Marina is on the south side of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It
        is next to the Burke-Gilman Trail and only steps from Seattle Pacific
        University. The marina can be found between the Freemont and Ballard bridges
        and a close hop to the Freemont Restaurant and Entertainment District and
        the historic Queen Anne Neighborhood. It is only minutes to downtown Seattle,
        the University of Washington, Gas Works Park, and the Space Needle.
